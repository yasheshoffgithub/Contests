# Contests Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Contests Solutions Repository! This repository contains solutions to various programming contest problems that I have solved during the contests as well as those I have upsolved afterward.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders by contest names. Each folder contains:

- **Problem/Contest Link**: Contest/problem link which you can copy and open in your browser easily.
- **Solution Code**: The code I wrote to solve the problem.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the Contests**: Navigate through the folders to find the contest you're interested in.
2. **View the Solutions**: Each problem folder contains a `solution.cpp` file with the solution code.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: All solutions are written in C++.
- **Markdown**: For documenting problem statements.
